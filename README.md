# Software_Engineering_Project

In this final project for software engineering, we utilize various technologies and use our acquired knowledge to design, implement and deploy a web application. The application is created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a JSON storage bin acting as our database. In this paper, we describe the process and work put in by the team to complete the project from the design phase to deployment.
